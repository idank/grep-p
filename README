Wrap grep to add -p/--show-function functionality, that is show the function
that the match is in.

This is mainly useful for things that aren't versioned by git.

Currently only Python files are supported, but adding more should be fairly
easy (for instance by stealing the expressions git is using from userdiff.c ;).

When -p isn't given it simply execs grep so this script can be aliased in
your .bashrc to grep.

Usage:

  foo.py:
  def foo():
      bar

  $ grep-p -pn bar foo.py
  1=def foo():
  2:    bar
